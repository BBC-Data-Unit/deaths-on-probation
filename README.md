In April 2019 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46386117) the number of people dying while on probation in England and Wales had risen by almost a third in three years.

Campaign groups said there had been "institutional indifference" towards offenders released from custody.

A social worker said her job had become "a treadmill of bureaucracy".

The Ministry of Justice said a "great deal of caution was needed when trying to draw conclusions" from its figures.

The BBC's Shared Data Unit analysed Ministry of Justice data from 2015-16 to 2017-18.

It found:

- Last year 966 deaths of offenders were recorded, compared to 752 in 2015-16
- About one in three of those deaths were self-inflicted
- In 2014-15, there were 558 deaths, but that was before 40,000 extra offenders were brought under supervision following government reforms
